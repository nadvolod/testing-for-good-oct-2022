### [About Environmental Working Group](https://www.ewg.org/)

We're advocates who won't quit. We're scientists that find solutions. We're people trying to make the safest choices for our health.

Since 1993, we've worked tirelessly to protect public health. Whether it's spotlighting harmful industry standards, speaking out against outdated government legislation or empowering consumers with breakthrough education and research, we're in this fight. 

And we're not going anywhere.
